## Issue 
The issue initially with the libraries which was my fault at first for not thinking but I put all of the dependencies onto my git repo which was not wise of me. 

- However was solved by simply removing it from the repo 
- and then having a documentation on letting the users know about the libraries that are needed to execute this project.
