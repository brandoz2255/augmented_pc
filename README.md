# Augmented PC!
This project I am on a journey to enhance my PC This PC begins with three Phases 

- **`Phase One`**: `Computer Vision` :: This is just giving my PC the ability to see and analyze stuff 
	- Will also listen to some signals to do stuff such as turn up the volume and down etc open windows
	- This part of the code is the test to future projects that involve usage of the Computer Vision aspect of this project 
	- But for now just to enhance my Computer with the ability to see to that I can tell it to something that normally a keyboard shortcut would do 
- **`Phase Two`**: `NLP` :: This is just to give my computer the ability to listen to natural English so it can do/automate stuff more when I need it to. 
	- Listen to me in a siri manner I use linux so I wanted this to be a linux's version of siri/Cortana 
	- Will do task's handling schedule stuff etc 
- **`Phase Three`**: Machine Learning :: This will give my computer machine learning to enhance my PC experience will randomly give me advice or recommend based on behaviors what I should do
